    <h2>Private Clients</h2>

    <p>Our aim is to complement the services provided to you by other experts.  Our ability to see the larger picture allows us to bring the various threads together – banking, investments, insurance, taxation, family structures, inheritance issues – making sure that everything fits together, and nothing is forgotten.  We can also help you with individual issues, if you prefer, and can perform various administrative duties for you on an ad hoc or an ongoing basis.</p>

    <h2>Corporate Entities</h2>

    <p>Documentation the world over is becoming more and more complex.  We specialise in documentation, be it filling out documents for others or creating documents for your own use.  We help to prepare KYC files, account opening forms and other applications, and compliance related documentation.  We can help draft letters and offer consultation on a variety of issues.</p>
